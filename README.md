# OGC API Building Blocks

Experimental repository for building blocks from the [OGC API standards](https://ogcapi.ogc.org).

Currently only building blocks from [Part 1: Core](http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/17-069r4.html) and [Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-058r1.html) of OGC API Features are included.

This is a work-in-progress.
